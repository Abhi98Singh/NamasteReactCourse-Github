        In React, we use React and ReactDOM API for creating element and manipulating DOM instead of document API


        React comes with a Philsophy of writing or manipulating the DOM using React(Javascript), at the end of the React is Javascript




        React and ReactDOM are React Libraries...

        React.createElement() method takes three arguments - i.)The element(u want to create), ii.){ attributes for element like id, class or variables}  iii.) what do you want inside your element (Element's children)



        'heading' and 'parent' are JS "object" and "React's elements"


        //render() method converts js obj into the tag which Browser understands




         <!-- React will overwrite everything inside "root" and replaces with whatever given inside render. -->
          <div id="root">
        <!-- React will overwrite everything inside "root" and replaces with whatever given inside render. -->
        <h1>It will be replaced!!!</h1>
                 </div>
